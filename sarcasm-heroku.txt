Actually I think you'll find that if you check attenhal's emails he did mention Clinton, and wetworks, and we really do have two options when we vote on November 28th: yes or no to making America great again.

I still think it's bizarre that Pence wants a little evening entertainment from the same people he targets while in office.
You have to MAGA.
To be honest, that gun isn't practical at all at this point.
But he was blackmailed to endorse her or hilldawg would be even less progressive, so it's all good.
shhh stop messing with the narrative - this was a racist shooting bc all cops are racist and this guy was 100% in the right and was a good boy going to college and he didn't even own a gun
Maybe he likes cod and wanted to try it?

Bizarre that a sub supporting the president is somehow toxic.
It would happen at compile time regardless.
Eye can see you up there...
That doesn't mean he hasn't exposed the disgusting side of the alt right or that your comment doesn't shine as a perfect example.
Too bad it requires such a large teapot though.

As nice as that sounds, with the scale of Infinity War being immense, this is Marvel's one opportunity to introduce the Symbiote in Space rather than on Earth, I feel like unless Marvel is going the Secret Wars route (which they may in fact be doing) then this is the golden opportunity for him to get the Black Suit and do Venom some justice in a 2nd/3rd Spider-Man film.
But the game doesn't normally cost less than the expansion.
High quality mp3s and flac sound the same.

Call it "Ghetto queue".
I'd say that "rigging" the primary and assuming she would get votes because she's a Democrat rather than campaigning in places like Wisconsin makes her unqualified.
Your stance that I am a dumb fuck is compelling argument that makes me seriously consider your position.

Luffy who is not on admiral level yet is getting the upper hand on big moms executive , and Jack is sleeping with the fishes after clashing with admirals.Marco on the other hand managed to kick an admiral who possesses the power of light accros marine fold , block akainus attack and take a direct hit from garps fist , borsalinos lasers and still get up like it's fucking nothing.Jozu with his diamond fruit and haki is probably close to invincible and this is just a speculation but could probably win against both jack and cracker as they are using brute force and weapons in combat rather then elemental attacks.We don't know how strong ace is because he got beat by blackbeard who is probably the main antagonist so he has plot armor + his devil fruit is one of the strongest in the series.

i'm not a big fan of the notion of giving EVERYONE welfare money, regardless of whether they need it, and then trying to claw it back from those deemed NOT to need it, via higher taxes i reckon those with complex tax arrangements who are able to legitimately minimise their taxable income are likely to be the biggest winners if this sort of proposal ever got off the ground i'd like to see more analysis on how such a proposal would affect the workforce my hunch is that wages would probably have to go up so that the financial differential between working and not working would be maintained, and to compensate for the extra tax that would be required to support the proposal, and higher wages would contribute to inflation the (local) workforce would probably shrink as well, with people who don't particularly like their job choosing to bite the bullet and live off the basic income as soon as they can afford to (kids left home, mortgage paid, etc) while i'm not ready to write the idea off completely, i'd like to see how well it works in an equivalent economy (NOT uganda) in order to allay some concerns
